Made a top rated page that filters all the games and only gets games with above 90 rating
I also learned alot about css this week and did some changes to the overall page

In the past week i did tons of stuff I did a majority of the css i changed most
of the fonts, layouts and colors of the site. I added the logo to the login page,
sign in page and the side bar. I was able to get a bug free dark mode that works
seemlessly. I added a search bar within the side bar. One of the features i
really like that i added  was that if you favorite a game you can go back to
your profile and you can choose a background from the list of games you
favorited. components wise I did the new releases page and the top rated page. I
also did error handling for the log in to show that your username or password
is incorrect. I also did error handling for the games detail page. If you
werent loggin in and you tried to add a game to your faborite or wishlist you
would get an alert that you need to sign or log in in order to do that. I did the
same with trying to create a review. Created a test for platforms as well.
