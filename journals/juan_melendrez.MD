## November 17, 2023 - End of Week


This week, I worked on the following tasks:


    *I created a database for Games, Platforms, and a junction table of the two called game_platforms


To kick things off, I created the table for games as well as a couple of endpoints for that table, specifically the GET all endpoint and a POST endpoint.


As we alternated between driving and being helpers mid-week, I did a bit of both, looking on others as they took the lead coding, I tried to identify any potential errors and assisted in the debuging process.


Towards the end of the week, I focused on creating more tables, specifcally the platforms table and a junction table called game_platforms. I then created various endpoints for these tables, a GET all and a POST for the platforms table and two GET methods for the game_platforms table that gets all the platforms relevant to a specific game id and all the games relevant to a specific platform_id.


This last section is where I faced a bit of struggle, trying to create the proper queries to grab the relevant information from the DBs was tough initially, luckily, some learn resources and the recent lectures on inner joins helped get this done. Moreso, I ran into failed pipelines during merge requests due to formatting issues but were resolved rather quickly using black. Other than this, the week went rather smoothly.
