This week I worked on:
Creating a table for the genre as well creating genre.py for the queries folder and routers folder. This is the POST request and working on the get request. I have practiced merging with the additional merge requests as well.

I created and imported the routers together. I also added the router or pathway to main.py. Also assisted in mob programming for the authentication with Peter, Juan, and Oscar.

Today, I learned how to set up the table properly for genre. It clicked in terms of what I needed to put in, which wasn't very much compared to certain things like the user.
It helped to solidify my knowledge on these types of things.

This week I worked on:
Creating a table for the reviews and creating the POST and GET request for reviews with Juan. I have done the merge requests and merges of the other team members.

I also helped Oscar with doing the sign up page on the front-end in react. I assisted with some minor debugging with him and a lot of things associated with authentication. I also worked on the login page. There is a blocker with trying to figure out how to redirect from the page.

Today, I learned how that I was redirecting to localhost:3000 instead of getting the token for localhost:8000 for my login page. I also learned about the navigation to redirect utilizing useNavigate library to the homepage. It was very useful.

This week I worked on creating the platform games or games associated with a platform. I added new migrations so that some pictures would be able to be utilized. Was able to work with some of the error handling as well. Had a lot of issues with the navbar and trying to pass in the token for the login in order for it to work.
I assisted with some debugging associated with some of the other group members associated with the game details and top-rated.

I learned how to pass in some of the pictures through the migrations that was utilized. Also learned how to pass through some css in order to make it aligned with how we want the site to look through.
