I made a dark mode for the frontend i was able to do it for each page seemlessly
I also made 2 endpoints for delete wishlist and favorites
Made a top rated page that filters all the games and only gets games with above 90 rating
I also learned alot about css this week and did some changes to the overall page
for my genres carousel i was able to make it so if you click on a specific genre it will link you to the specified genre
