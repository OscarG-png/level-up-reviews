This week I worked on:
Creating a table for the genre as well creating genre.py for the queries folder and routers folder. This is the POST request and working on the get request. I have practiced merging with the additional merge requests as well.

I created and imported the routers together. I also added the router or pathway to main.py. Also assisted in mob programming for the authentication with Peter, Juan, and Oscar.

Today, I learned how to set up the table properly for genre. It clicked in terms of what I needed to put in, which wasn't very much compared to certain things like the user.
It helped to solidify my knowledge on these types of things.
